# Tank-Controller-Models
The objective of this Model-Based Development assignment was to implement a PID controller and a sequential controller for a tank control system. These controller models were designed in order to control the level of liquid in the tank. The tank control system is developed in Simulink. A detailed report on how the controller models were set up and the theory behind them can be found below.
